"""
Tests for MEM-008 — natural-language causal-graph traversal.

Mirrors the style of the causal-graph and nlquery tests in test_memory.py:
build a small causal graph, ask plain-English questions, and assert that the
question compiles into the correct traversal (upstream vs downstream) and
surfaces the right nodes.
