# Accessibility Audit and WCAG Compliance Review

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive accessibility audit was conducted across the AgentWatch frontend application. No critical accessibility blockers were identified, but a high-priority issue concerning the generic Modal component's focus management and screen reader support was found and addressed. 

## Audit Areas & Findings

### 1. Keyboard-Only Navigation
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Major workflows (session lists, details, rollback) are navigable via keyboard. The Tab order follows the visual hierarchy.

### 2. Focus Management & Visible Indicators
- **Status:** Pass (after remediation)
- **Findings:** Previously, the modal dialogues did not trap focus. This has been remediated. Focus indicators (outline) are visible on interactive elements.

### 3. Screen Reader Compatibility
- **Status:** Pass (after remediation)
- **Findings:** Core pages communicate state correctly. The missing ole="dialog" and ria-modal="true" properties were added to the Modal.

### 4. Semantic HTML Usage
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Proper heading hierarchies (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) and semantic tags (<section>, <main>, <header>) are used appropriately.

### 5. ARIA Roles and Labels
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Custom components have necessary ARIA properties. Modal title association (ria-labelledby) has been verified.

### 6. Modal Accessibility
- **Status:** Pass (remediated)
- **Findings:** 
  - Added ole="dialog" and ria-modal="true".
  - Added ria-labelledby for screen reader context.
  - Implemented focus trapping inside the modal.
  - Ensured focus is returned to the triggering element upon closure.

### 7. Color Contrast
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Text and background color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio).

### 8. Form Accessibility
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Inputs and selects are correctly associated with visible labels or have adequate contextual labeling.

### 9. Mobile Accessibility
- **Status:** Pass
- **Findings:** Touch targets are adequate size, and the interface responds to zoom without breaking layout.

## Remediation Log
* **[High Priority]** Implemented a reusable, accessible Modal component in rontend/components/Modal.tsx and updated the session rollback flow to utilize it, ensuring keyboard focus trapping and correct screen reader semantics.

## Conclusion
The frontend currently meets general WCAG compliance for core workflows. Continual testing should be enforced for new components.
