RSN-011 — Why This Was Blocked AI Explainer.

When an action is blocked, generate a plain-English explanation:
    - which rule / threshold triggered
    - what the agent was trying to do
    - what the safe alternative would be

Output is fully template-driven; if a custom LLM judge is wired in,
its rationale is used to enrich the explanation.
