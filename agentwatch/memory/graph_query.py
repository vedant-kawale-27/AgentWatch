"""
MEM-008 — Natural Language Causal-Graph Traversal.

A natural-language query interface for the causal memory graph. Parses a
plain-English question (e.g. "Why did we choose Postgres over MySQL in the
previous session?") and compiles it into a *graph traversal* over the
:class:`~agentwatch.memory.causal_graph.CausalGraph` — following causal edges
between nodes — rather than the flat key/value lookup performed by
:mod:`agentwatch.memory.nlquery` (MEM-007).

The distinction matters: MEM-007 ranks independent memory rows by keyword and
embedding similarity. This module instead picks an *entry node* in the causal
graph and then walks the graph's edges (upstream for "why" questions,
downstream for "what happened next" questions) to surface the causal *path*
that answers the question.

Resolution is deterministic and dependency-free: it reuses the hashed-vector
``embed``/``cosine`` helpers from :mod:`agentwatch.scoring.drift` (which fall
back to a stable hashing embedding when sentence-transformers is unavailable),
with a keyword-overlap signal blended in.
