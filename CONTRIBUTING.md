# Community & Support

Join the AgentWatch community:

💬 Discord:
https://discord.com/invite/ZbQ9m9HtnE

The Discord server is the best place for:

- Asking development questions
- Discussing features before building them

- Following project updates
- Connecting with other contributors

If you're planning a larger feature or architectural change, we strongly recommend discussing it in Discord first.

Open-source works best when contributors communicate early.

# Before You Start

## Check Existing Work

Before creating an issue or pull request:

- Search existing issues
- Search existing pull requests
- Check project discussions
- Verify the issue has not already been reported

Duplicate reports create unnecessary review overhead.

---

## Discuss Large Changes First

For significant features, architectural changes, or major refactors:

Please open an issue first.

This helps ensure:

- The feature aligns with project goals
- Development effort is not wasted
- Maintainers can provide guidance early

---

# Issue Guidelines

## High Quality Issues

Good issues include:

- Clear problem description
- Reproduction steps
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Relevant logs or screenshots
- Environment information

Example:

```text
Expected:
Session should reconnect automatically

Actual:
Connection remains disconnected after network recovery
```

---

## Enhancement Requests

Enhancement requests should answer:

### What problem exists?

Explain the current limitation.

### Why is it valuable?

Describe the impact.

### What is the proposed solution?

Provide a reasonable implementation direction.

---

## Low Quality Issues

Issues may be closed if they:

- Cannot be reproduced
- Lack sufficient details
- Duplicate existing reports
- Are generated from automated scans without verification
- Are speculative without evidence

Quality matters more than quantity.

---

# Pull Request Guidelines

## Keep PRs Focused

A pull request should solve one logical problem.

Good examples:

- Fix one bug
- Add one feature
- Improve one documentation area

Avoid:

- Massive unrelated refactors
- Multiple independent features
- Formatting-only changes mixed with functional changes

---

## Pull Request Requirements

Before opening a PR:

- Code builds successfully
- Tests pass
- New tests are added when appropriate
- Documentation is updated when needed
- No unrelated files are modified

---

## Pull Request Title Format

Use conventional commits.

Examples:

```text
fix: resolve websocket reconnect issue

feat: add reasoning confidence dashboard

docs: improve installation guide

test: add safety engine integration coverage
```

---

## Pull Request Description

Use:

```md
## Summary

Short explanation of the change.

## Changes

- Change 1
- Change 2

## Validation

- Ran tests
- Tested locally
- Verified frontend build
```

---

# Code Quality Standards

## Python

- Follow PEP8
- Prefer type hints
- Write readable code
- Keep functions focused
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions

---

## Frontend

- Keep components modular
- Minimize dependencies
- Maintain UI consistency
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

---

# Testing

Run before submitting:

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

Frontend:

Documentation contributions are highly encouraged.

Examples:

- Tutorials

Documentation-only contributions are welcome.

---

# Security Issues

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately through GitHub Security Advisories or project contact channels.

---

# Review Process

All pull requests are reviewed by maintainers.
