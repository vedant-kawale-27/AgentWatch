"""
Demo agent for AgentWatch — exercises the full watch() → dashboard pipeline.

Usage:
    # Terminal 1: start the API server
    agentwatch serve

    # Terminal 2: run this script
    python real_agent.py

Then open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sessions)
and watch the session appear in real time.
